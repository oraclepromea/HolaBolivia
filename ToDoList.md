# ToDo List

- [x] Can you remove the image for each of the review, there seems to be a broken image for each review - remove it but keep everything else the same
- [x] For each of the tours can you replace the "see details" button with a Whatsapp link to book each specific tour - make sure each link is unique. 
- [x] For the hero image, can you remove the opacity so the image looks better
- [x] Can you add a tripadvisor icon of a map for the links. 
- [x] In the footer can you make the social media links look better, currently they are dark blue and off theme and the styling is off.
